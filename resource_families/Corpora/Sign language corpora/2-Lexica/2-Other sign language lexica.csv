The basic purpose of Norwegian Signbank is to serve as a tool in annotating Norwegian Sign Language texts. Linguistic annotations are attached to video time codes, and the coded material can be used to create a corpus of sign language texts. In the corpus work of sign languages, each lexical sign (i.e. a sign which has an established form and meaning) is given a unique name, a gloss (e.g. HUND or JENTE). In addition to the gloss, Norwegian Signbank contains the citation form of the sign on video, the sign’s Norwegian and English translation equivalents, and selected phonological characteristics of the sign. The database is still under development and is unpublished.";;;;;
