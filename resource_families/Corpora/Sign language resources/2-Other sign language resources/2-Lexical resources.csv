The first is a frontal view of the upper part of the body. The second one is similar, but with the camera placed about one meter higher than the first one so as to produce a frontal top-view, and thus allowing to detect 3D information. The last view is a frontal-detail view of the speaker's face, thus allowing lip-reading.";;;;;
