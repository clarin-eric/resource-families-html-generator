The aim of the original project and the follow-up study was to analyse the second language competences of South-Tyrolean pupils from upper secondary schools (between 16 and 18 years old), and to contextualize the results of such investigation by commenting on crucial sociolinguistic and psychosocial aspects that influence it. The results of the follow-up study should be compared to the results of the original <a href=""https://www.porta.eurac.edu/lci/kolipsi-family/"">KOLIPSI project</a>.#SEPAll sub-corpora of the Kolipsi Corpus Family contain manually performed transcription annotations. Transcription annotations reflect surface features of the text, such as the graphical arrangement, and include error annotation on the orthographic level.#SEPBoth subcorpora of KOLIPSI are available for download from the Eurac Research CLARIN Centre Repository.

The pupils were 11 years old at the beginning of the data collection and 13 years old at the end. In each grade, two written texts were collected that differ with respect to genre: the first text was elicited using a picture story re-telling task; the second text is an opinion text on different aspects related to the pupils’ life and public discourse.#SEPManual annotation concerns the fact that the corpus is fully anonymised and annotated with target hypotheses correcting orthography errors in the text as well as annotations on structural elements (paragraphs, line breaks, bullet points, symbols or emoticons etc.), foreign word insertions and transcript surface features (e.g. deletions, corrections or insertions of the student, unreadable or ambiguous items).#SEPThe corpus is available for download from the the Eurac Research CLARIN Centre Repository.";"L2 learner corpora";"Download";"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12124/25";"Glaznieks et al.
